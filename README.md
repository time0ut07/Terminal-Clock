# Terminal-Clock

My first project in C :D

Wanted to try get used to the syntax and try to get use to C. Still don't really know how to use memory functions to increase the efficiency of the clock (for fun).

## Functions

Some functions I have implemented includes:

|Key|Function|Description|
|---|--------|-----------|
|`h`|Help menu|Toggle help menu|
|`q`|Quit|Exit clock|
|`c`|Clock type|Toggle clock type (12h/24h)|
|`a`|Alarm|Set alarm|
|`d`|Remove alarm|Delete current alarm|

## Future Plans
1. Implement stopwatch
2. When alarm is invoked, send SMS to user's phone
3. Free up memory when alarm is deleted
